# Predictive-model-for-stock-price
This model uses neural networks, specifically long short-term memory networks to predict whether the stock prices will go up or down. We tested our model using historical stock data of two different companies (Google and Amazon). Based on the results, we were able to make predictions with slightly higher than 50% accuracy (54% for Google’s stock and 52% for Amazon’s stock).
